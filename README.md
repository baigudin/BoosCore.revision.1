# BOOS Core R1

**THIS REVISION IS DEPRECIATED AND NOT EVOLVING ANYMORE**

BOOS Core is an object-oriented operating kernel for small embedded systems. The kernel is written in C++ programming language and can be used into small microcontrollers with limited resources. BOOS Core has a hardware independent application program interface which allows porting user source codes easily if hardware environment is changed.
